# ICAP

## Summary
This is a MATLAB source code of the paper "Improved Color Attenuation Prior for Single-Image Haze Removal", published in Applied Sciences-Basel (MDPI). The algorithm, which will be referred to as ICAP for short, was developed from the color attenuation prior proposed by Zhu et al. [1] by addressing several shortcomings like color distortion, background noise, and over-removal of haze. The figure below depicts the block diagram of the ICAP, in which the blocks highlighted by red rectangles are pertinent to new features proposed in the paper [2].

# Run the code
The source code is in the *ICAP* folder, and the demonstration is shown by executing the *demo.m* file in **MATLAB** environment.

*NOTE*: The souce code of adaptive tone remapping algorithm is excluded due to copyright restriction.
